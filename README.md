Change CSGO's Panorama UI backgrounds

This converter changes the standard background of the Panorama UI to an custom one.
Supported formats are JPG,BMP,PNG,MP4,AVI,WEBM, and possibly more.
Backgrounds do get reset every update, nothing i can do about that.

This software is currently not VAC or Faceit bannable and you can always manually or automatically
reverse the background.

With that said, use is at your own risk.

# known issues

- The source code is quite large, because of unused files.
- Currently we use an windows script to run ffmpeg
- The programme is a little bit slow and storage heavy
